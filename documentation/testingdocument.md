## Testing document

Unittesting report [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Scarrat/tiralabra/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=KXH4PSGWHR)](https://codecov.io/gh/Scarrat/tiralabra)  

Testing at the moment is very barebones with only the 2 simple unittests checking that huffman encoding and decoding works correctly. The main point of the program: compression, has not been tested yet since the compression algorithm is not working adequately enough for me to put a test for it.
