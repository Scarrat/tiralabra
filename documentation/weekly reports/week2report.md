## Week 2 Report:  

Researched how to implement Huffman algorithm. Implemented a basic version for encoding/decoding, wasted too much time on stuff I had simply forgotten how do to or files were not playing nice. Learned properly how Huffman tree works(I think :D), no major problems other than reading comprehension.

Next week plan is to fix the huffman decoding output so it works with already encoded files, make the file more properly usable in general, and start LZ77 implementation possibly if I have time.

Time used this week ~12 hours.
