## Week 3 Report:  

Implemented a way to store the necessary data needed to decompress the file inside the compressed file. Caused tons of issues which when fixed caused more issues. Problem with trying to read different types of data from a file turned into dictionary changing during compression and different symbols giving me a headache. Might need to rework whole huffman algorithm next week. Feel like these could have simple fixes but I just don't know about them :D.

Time spent: ~11 hours

Next week: Reworking huffman? or start with LZ and figure this one out later? Not quite sure yet. If I get huffman to play nice Ill have more time and less gray hairs.
