## Week 5 Report:  

Week spent reading up on LZ77, built a couple different starts, didn't really seem to work, compression was bad, speed was bad, I think i don't quite "get" it yet. Going to finish it next week.

Time spent: 12 hours.

Next week: Completing the LZ77, catching up on some of the documentation stuff.
