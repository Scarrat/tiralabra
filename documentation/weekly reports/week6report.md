## Week 6 Report:

Found a way to get the Lempel-Ziv to work adequately, still very slow at bigger files but I'm not sure if I can improve it. Added a working UI. Wrote more documentation. 

Problems: The way the Lempel-Ziv algorithm saves the data to a file at the moment resembles more LZSS than LZ77, is this okay or should I change the name/make it work the original way? Tried to read up on it and apparently its considered pretty much same but just want to make sure. I had lot of trouble with the ways to make it save the data. Bit manipulation is not really not my forte it seems, and the libraries like struct just gave me a headache or suboptimal results.

Time spent: 15 hours

Next week: Make actual UI? Improvements? Documentation?
