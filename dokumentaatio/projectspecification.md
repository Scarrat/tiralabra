## Project Specification


The purpose of the program is to implement Huffman and Lempel-Ziv(LZ77) compression algorithms on a program so it can be used to compress a file to a smaller size(<60%) using one of the algorithms. Program input is a file and output is a compressed file and vice versa. Aimed time complexities are O(nlogn) for Huffman and O(n) for LZ77.  

I chose the subject because data compression is used in pretty much everything and it's somewhat new and interesting to me.
